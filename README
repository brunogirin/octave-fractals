=====================================================================

I originally created this set of Octave scripts out of curiosity about
fractals and in particular the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. I then decided
to talk about it and share the code and some sample images on my weblog,
at http://brunogirin.blogspot.com/
The functions and script presented here are the ones I used to
produce the images.

INSTALLATION

You will need to have Octave installed to run this code. In order to do
so, on Ubuntu or any other Debian derivative, open a terminal window and
run the following:

sudo apt-get install octave

USAGE

Using this code is extremely simple. Extract all the files in a single
directory, change directory to where they were extracted and just run
the main script using octave:

octave fractaldemo.m

This will produce a set of .ppm files that have been numbered according
to the order in which they appeared on the blog.

You can then convert the .ppm files into .png or other with ImageMagick.
